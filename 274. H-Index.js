Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

//medium


function hIndex(citations) {
  var map = {};
  var h = citations.length;
  var i = 0;
  var max = 0;
  citations.map(c => map[c] = map[c] ? map[c] + 1 : 1);
  for (; i <= h; i++) {
    max = Math.max(max, h >= i ? i : 0);
    h -= map[i] ? map[i] : 0;
  }
  return max;
}
